I believe each human has the inherent responsibility to use their intellect to improve the world as much as possible. I also believe that right now, science and technology are the best tools to accomplish that. However, I am aware that they are not the only ones.

I work with computers, but I also deeply interested in other fields. These include writing, sustainability, space exploration and education.

I want to spend my time and energy creating a better world. Get in touch if you want to help me.
