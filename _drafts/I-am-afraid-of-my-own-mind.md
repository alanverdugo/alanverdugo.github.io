  I am afraid of my own mind.
</p>

In an effort of taking absolute control of every aspect of my life, from some time ago I have tried to achieve lucid dreaming, this is, achieving a state of full consciousness inside a dream. The dreamer then will have knowledge of being inside a dream, and most of the time, this knowledge will grant the dreamer absolute control of what will happen in said dream. I have had few and spontaneous successes, but this has not worked very well. In fact, instead of achieving full lucidity while dreaming, my dreams have become more and more realistic and undistinguishable from the real life.

I have come to a point where I can only tell that I am not dreaming by having a slight feeling of familiarity with the things and places I see around me. For this reason, experiences that seem normal but are still out of the ordinary, like, for example, waking up in an unknown bed, can be extremely confusing and disorienting experiences.

While studying lucid dreaming, I have learned techniques used to identify when one is dreaming or not. For example, trying to do any reading inside a dream is supposed to be impossible[1]. Since the brain hemisphere used for reading is not active at dreamtime, any alphabetic characters would be intelligible, and thus, unreadable. However, my subconscious is overriding this, by, indeed, not showing the correct characters, but making me think that I have read them correctly nonetheless. This is how I realized that I have a clever, and very mischievous subconscious. Evidently, it is also capable of inserting ideas into my conscious very easily and having the ability to make me think whatever seems fitting.

The subconscious is totally taking over whenever we dream, I dislike this because I cannot control it, and because I somehow feel that it is getting worse.

In my dreams, I constantly see things that could never exist within the Euclidean realm, I draw patterns so complex and precise that make fractals look like stick figures, I hear and compose songs I have never heard before and see colours that the human eye is simply unable to perceive. To somebody that has studied and has been trained in the exact sciences and earns my living by using only logic, it seems that the illogical part of my mind is becoming more powerful as well, but, at the same time, it is also becoming more random, unpredictably creative and, I am afraid to say, uncontrollable.

Is this how artists become so creative? By somehow allowing their subconscious to control more of their minds than common people normally do? Is the price of great creativity losing a great degree of control over something as basic as one&#8217;s own mind?

&#8220;No art is possible without a dance with death, he wrote.&#8221;

Conscious and unconscious co-exist and have a very strong and symbiotic relationship, but one has the majority of control at dreamtime and the other assumes control while we are awake. They switch places constantly, and we could not say that one or the other really has absolute control at all times (which is what lucid dreaming tries to change), it is just that our conscious mind happens to be the one in charge when we do our living, and thus we assume that this is our true self. While awake, the subconscious still has control of a little part of the mind, which I think is where spontaneity and creativity come from, in the same fashion of how the conscious mind still has some control while we are sleeping, so we can, for example, remember real things, people, and events even inside the dreams and use that as the context and characters of our dreams and nightmares. So, in order to write this text I have to use and grant some control to my subconscious, this is to get the inspiration and somewhat random ideas necessary to properly write, which, as we all know, is an inherently creative process.

Being able to constantly achieve lucid dreaming must be something that can only be done by those whose conscious is much more powerful that their subconscious, to the point where the conscious mind can even control the realm of the subconscious, i.e. one&#8217;s dreams and nightmares.

What happens if my subconscious becomes so powerful that it could take over my mind even when I am not sleeping? This is the definition of madness, of literally losing one&#8217;s mind. And I cannot fathom something more horrible than losing my mind to my own subconscious. I have seen what my subconscious is capable of doing and I do not even want to think of doing some of those things in the real world.

Insane people still have a basic degree of control over their bodies, which allows them to still be able to perform basic functions, like talking. This must be the conscious mind still having some degree of control over them. They just let go and allowed their subconscious to take over the bast majority of their mind. However, I do not like the idea of just being a mere spectator of the events that an unknown part of me is controlling. It would be like watching a movie where my body is the protagonist but my mind is outside of it and somebody else is controlling my actions. Is this the hell insane people suffer every day?

How close I am to lose my mind? What if every night I am close of granting total control of my mind to my subconscious? What if every night we take the risk of waking up and having the subconscious still controlling everything? How close are we of losing our minds definitively every night? Is this how people become insane?
