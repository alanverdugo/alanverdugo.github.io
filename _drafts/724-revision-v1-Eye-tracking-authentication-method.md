<p style="text-align: justify;">
  User-facing cameras are ubiquitous in today&#8217;s devices like laptops, cellphones and tablets. Eye-tracking software is also becoming more and more ubiquitous for different applications.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Advantages:
</p>

<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Improved security. This authentication method is virtually impervious to &#8220;shoulder surfing&#8221; attacks. For a human, it is almost impossible to tell the exact point where a person is looking.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Improved customization for passwords. The user can choose to set his or her password to a specific figure, a color, a letter or to the position of the shape. The user is also able to customize the amount of time that is required staring at the correct &#8220;password&#8221; for the authentication to complete. Any combination of these factors is also possible, improving the password strength even further. For example, the user could choose to authenticate while staring at a purple-colored square with the letter &#8220;B&#8221; in it for more than 4 seconds, making it a strong &#8220;password&#8221;. A simpler example would be to stare at any hexagon with for only two seconds, this would be an example of a weaker &#8220;password&#8221;.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Improved usability. Individuals with disabilities will find this authentication method easier to use. For example, typed passwords are hard to use for individuals with hand-related disabilities. In order to use this authentication method, the only requirement is to have control over his or her eye movement.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Future-proof. New devices like VR and AR headsets will require an authentication method that does not depend on typed passwords or voice recognition. The proposed authentication method will integrate perfectly to the nature of these devices.
</li>
