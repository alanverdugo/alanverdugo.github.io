-So, what is going to be this time?  
-I&#8217;m not sure yet, this ecosystem is quite complex for having such a boring star. Maybe I&#8217;ll go with some kind of fungus. I have high hopes for them.  
-You always say that.  
-And I am usually right.  
-How about those weird hominids? You seem to be a fan of them.  
-Don&#8217;t be ridiculous. I admit they have potential, but we both know they, at least, will end up extinguishing themselves.  
-What if they kill themselves and also all the other species? It seems very likely.  
-What do you mean, just kill all the other species, or if they make the planet inhospitable?  
-Just if they kill everything for a reasonable period. If they completely destroy the planet for any kind of life, we forget this and move to the next system.  
-Mmm&#8230; sounds interesting. What do you want to bet?  
-Alright, I bet one of those binary star systems you like so much. I got two new ones built and another one fully cleaned and restored. I even added rings to one of the bigger planets.  
-Oh, you mean the system with the fully volcanic super-planet? I want that one.  
-That&#8217;s the one. You can have if your species wins. What are you betting?  
-Ok, I&#8217;m betting my old ship, that old one always wanted.  
-That&#8217;s not enough, I do like it, but just for nostalgia. What else do you have?  
-Ok, I&#8217;ll add this year&#8217;s full statistics, forecasts and DNA tables. That could help you win in the next bets.  
-Yes, but not always, remember that meteorite that wiped out those lizards? The DNA forecasts will not predict anything like that. Hey, didn&#8217;t that happen in this same system?  
-It could be, I honestly don&#8217;t pay attention to those things anymore.  
-I&#8217;m still pretty sure you cheated and sent that meteorite. You knew the lizards were fully dominant, they were so close to winning. We just had to wait a trillion years or two and they would have made contact with us.  
-You know the rules, we cannot help or tamper with any species development. You want to play or not?  
-Ok, I&#8217;ll do it. Maybe I&#8217;ll pick that vegetarian ursid, let&#8217;s make it interesting.  
-Ok then, I&#8217;ll go with the those stupid hominids.  
-Ha! Are you sure? You can&#8217;t change it later!  
-Yeah, I have a hunch.  
-You better not be cheating again!
