  After reading a very serious (and even depressing) post from my friend Cyrus, I started thinking in long-term data storage and how it could be used for storing genetic information of endangered species.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The sad thing here is, when I talk about endangered species, I do not only think about pandas and rhinos. I am including the humans in the list.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  As a side note, my friend talks about a really good manga simply named &#8220;Hotel&#8221;. It is a futuristic sciencie fiction story about how humankind destroys the climate and, as a last effort to atone its sins, stores genetic information of the world&#8217;s species in a &#8220;hotel&#8221;, which is a giant tower in the antarctic. The AI in the tower tries to protect the genetic information at any cost, but time itself is a mighty foe and it entropy is a big challenge.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  After thinking about all this, I did some research in ultra-long data storage. To really preserve data of such importance, common methods of data storage are simply not enough.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  There are various factors to consider:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  -Resilent. Impervious to degradation. Or a least, that it should have a way to store redundant data and correct errors.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  -Easy to extract, read, and understand. We just cannot rely on data standards to be the same for millions of years. Chances are, there will be no USB ports or SD card readers available at the time. Any Bluray discs will probably be regarded only as pretty mirrors.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  -Storage capacity.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  An interesting attempt of long-term data storage easily understandable format was made by Carl Sagan in the famous golden disc.
