          1984 is a book written by George Orwell. It was published in 1949. It is about a government who has absolute control of the citizens. The government has surveillance in every room, it changes history and even the language at will, it spreads lies, fear and deception in order accomplish the only goal a government can have: to retain its power and expand it as much as possible. 1984 is a distopic cautionary tale, warning us about a future that could have been, a future that will be (if we are not careful) and about a future that already is&#8230; if you pay close attention.
        </p>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          If I remember correctly, in 1984 (the book, not the year) there are no words for &#8220;bad&#8221; and its synonyms. They use &#8220;nogood&#8221; and that is one of the principles Big Brother applies in order to control the masses: neolinguistics. &#8220;Newspeak&#8221; is the name of the new language which is specifically designed to narrow self-expression and to limit the lexicon, thus, indirectly controlling the mind of the speaker. Newspeak is just like Facebook. We do not have a &#8220;dislike&#8221; button in Facebook. If you think about it, it is easy to understand why they do not add it. This is a feature that has been requested since the advent of Facebook and the implementation of such a feature should be trivial, but maybe they do not add a dislike button because they want to keep Facebook as a place where there is no &#8220;hate&#8221;, a place where your friends &#8220;like&#8221; your pictures or, in the worst case scenario, they do not have any opinion about them. There is no &#8220;dislike&#8221; in Facebook. So, it is a place where, using the &#8220;like&#8221; system, you can go to receive easy gratification or no gratification at all, but never hate. This is very appealing for the masses, even if they are not aware of that. Facebook is a relatively safe haven in a sea of hateful websites.

          Youtube has &#8220;like&#8221; and &#8220;dislike&#8221; buttons. The result of this is disagreement, hate, racism and discussion. However, discussion is needed in order to share and improve ideas, and this is the primary objective of a social network. We need to disagree just as much as we need to agree. In fact, disagreement is the first step towards agreement. The second step, is discussion.

          I would not be surprised if in the social networks of the future you can only &#8220;like&#8221; things, and nothing else.

              In fact, since Google+ launched after Facebook, it seemed natural to think that they would add a dislike button from the first day. As we know, they didn&#8217;t do it and it looks like they will never do it. They must have figured out the same thing: a dislike button is a bad idea for a social network.

          It is much easier to click on a button than to write a comment saying how much you liked a comment. No, society does not have time to write even a one-line comment anymore, with luck, we only have time to click a button. In order to write something, you need to think of it first, but that takes time and we no longer have time for that. I want you to read that again: We no longer have time to think. And we don&#8217;t need to think anymore.

      Let&#8217;s imagine a social network where we only are allowed to &#8220;dislike&#8221; content. By definition, the best, and most popular content, would be the content with the fewer &#8220;dislikes&#8221;. This, obviously, would not be a very polite social network, and it would not be a very popular network with the masses. We should be allowed to agree and to disagree with any comment. If we will not accept this side of the spectrum, why are we accepting the other one?

      Facebook is doing as easily as possible to show your agreement to something, but it is making you think twice about writing a negative comment just by having to take the &#8220;extra&#8221; step of typing it. The one-way road to the illusion of happiness and friendliness is paved with lies and psychological tricks. The road to disagreement, dialog and discussion is hidden and not traveled enough for fear of rejection.
