  Few names in the hardware industry have as much reputation and tradition as the Thinkpad brand. There are <a href="http://www.forum.thinkpads.com/" target="_blank">many</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/" target="_blank">forums</a> and groups where passionate fans share reviews, buy, sell and trade. Even old and used Thinkpads are sought after
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I have been using a Thinkpad T430 as my workstation for the last three years, it was assigned to me at work and it runs a custom version of Red Hat. Since I have enjoyed using it, I decided to buy a Thinkpad X1 Carbon to replace an old Toshiba netbook that I used for more personal endeavors.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The X series of Thinkpads are marketed as &#8220;ultraportable productivity tools&#8221; and that is a fitting description. The laptop itself is incredibly light and thin. You can easily tell (and feel) that it was designed and built with quality and usability in mind. Thinkpads always look serious and professional, and this is something I prefer over flashy LED arrays, bright colors or shiny decorations. The battery lasts for several hours.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Since there are many hardware reviews for the X1 Carbon, I will focus more on my experience and the compatibility with Linux, which is something I absolutely require.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The good
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The designated courier for Mexico is DHL, which is pretty good and fast. It took them only two days to get the Thinkpad from Lenovo&#8217;s mexican offices to my door, which is very fast for mexican standards. The shipment is free for all Lenovo products.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The bad
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Windows 10 comes pre-installed and I was never offered a choice over which OS I wanted (not even which version of Windows). I would have preferred to have some sort of Linux distribution pre-installed or no OS at all, which could lower the cost of the laptop and thus would be greatly appreciated. Dell and other hardware vendors have explored the possibility of offering alternative operating systems in their products, but, evidently, Lenovo has not noticed this opportunity. Meanwhile, I feel I paid for a Windows license that I will never use, and it is not a good feeling. I actually tried to give Windows 10 a chance, I wanted to see how Windows has evolved in the years I have not used it and I found it much more visually appealing than I expected. However, the serious security issues and the fact that it was adamant in not granting me permission to install another OS alongside it.

  I was never offered a choice of the courier or shipment method. Thankfully, DHL offered a great service (as mentioned before), but a giving the customer a choice would be nice.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In the same way, I didn&#8217;t have a choice regarding which keyboard layout the laptop would have. Since I way buying it from Mexico, I was given a latin american standard keyboard. No complaints there, I do need some way to write accents and other characters, but I would like to choose the language or even maybe a DVORAK layout.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The RAM is soldered into the board, thus it is functionally impossible to replace it or add another module.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Since Lenovo products are basically made only after you order them, it can be a long time until they ship them. It took around two weeks for them to built and send it to Lenovo&#8217;s facilities in Mexico (which then shipped it to me).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Lenovo offers a web tool to track the status of the ordered items.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The conclusion
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  After all this, would I buy another Lenovo product? Certainly. I am satisfied with the quality of the product. The price is high but the investment is worth it if you can afford it and if you are really going to exploit the hardware instead of using it only to browse the web.
