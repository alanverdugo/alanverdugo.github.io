  Analyze the pictures in social media accounts in order to try to find new people.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Example:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  If somebody reports a person as lost, an algorithm will analyze past pictures of the lost person in their social media accounts, then monitor all the social networks trying to find a new picture of the person. If a new picture is found, it should send a notification. This will use image recognition and web crawling.
