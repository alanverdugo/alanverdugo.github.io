  Dear sinner,
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  You have decided to stain our family with you lack of belief. Our daughter has been, obviously, blinded by love/Satan and claims you are a good person. I still don&#8217;t know if you are also blinded by Satan or are Satan himself, but it does not matter. Your actions speak for themselves. The fact that you have not attended any of our regular Bible studies even when you said you would think about it, is an obvious sign of your lack of interest and hope for salvation. I know a lie when I see one.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This so-called &#8220;union&#8221; of yours is not an appropriate replacement for the Holy Sacrament Of Marriage, regardless of the amount of people that attended the party or the delicious cake. I could easily tell I was not welcome in your sinful celebration, the number of gay friends and man-buns was too high to be a coincidence. It was like you where rubbing it in my face.
</p>

I even saw a couple of men dancing (with each other!) to almost-blasphemous modern music.

But remember: God works in mysterious ways.

&#8230;as God intended.

However, I am not a cruel person. I will try to forgive you if you repent sincerely. I will again invite you to join us in the Right Path, or you may prefer to find a cozier place, like the eternal flames of hell.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Amen.
</p>
