  Since I was very young I was interested in computers.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I wanted to use all those amazing computers that appeared on the movies.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  However, when I got a little older and I finally got my first computer I was extremely disappointed. All the computer interfaces looked as if they were designed by PlaySkool. Windows XP and Mac OS were, by far, the worse offenders. I felt patronized, as if Microsoft and Apple had no trust at all in my intelligence, so they put a big musical note icon in the audio-related software, a big diskette icon for saving files and so on. I understand that they are aiming for accessibility and a friendly user interface, but they went too far and ended in Idiocracy&#8217;s ER section.

    PAIN = BAD!

          A few years later I discovered Linux. The fact that Linux and its environment is not developed by an established company meant that there were no rigid rules about how the graphic interface should look. For the first time, I found a place where I could make my computer act exactly how I wanted. Sadly, I also discovered some of Linux&#8217;s most popular desktop environments suffered from the dumbed down GUI school of thought.

        I eventually ended working on CLI-only servers, where the keyboard is king and mice have always been exiled. I went so far as to try to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_%28web_browser%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lynx</a>, a text-only web browser. I learned the ancient art of those who came before me, the old way of completely using a computer without any graphical interface. But there had to be a middleground.
