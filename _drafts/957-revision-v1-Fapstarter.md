A site where users can stream video from their webcams, and other users can see their stream and cooperate in order to pay them for performing certain actions.

&nbsp;

It will need to:

-Allow to stream video from a webcam.

-Allow multichat communication in every stream.

-Perform credit card transactions in order to pay for every action.

-Keep records of all the transactions/chats/streams.
