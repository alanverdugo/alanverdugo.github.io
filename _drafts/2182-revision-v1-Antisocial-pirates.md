Distopyan future in which people are registered into social networks from the moment they are born.

Pirates try to remove their records and live a life outside the grid.

A pregnant woman hides to give birth. Her daughter will be free of surveillance.

They escape to a community of antisocial pirates where they are not tracked anymore.
