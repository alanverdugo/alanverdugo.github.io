      When I was a young boy, a group of friends invited me to an abandoned house. We all were around 5 or 6 years old and it never occurred to us that we were commuting a crime, or maybe we just did not care.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      The house was located in front of our elementary school, so during recess we managed to get out of the school grounds and enter the house. I do not remember how we found the house or how we opened the door every time, but I remember that it was not a completely abandoned house, it was just unoccupied at that time. This meant that we were always alert of the owners discovering us. Of course, this made everything much more exciting.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      We never vandalized anything. I still want to think that our minds were not entirely corrupted yet, so the fact of being in a prohibited place was enough mischief for us. We entered the house, stood there for all the time we could and then left. We didn&#8217;t even talked about it. Being in there seemed to be a powerful experience for all of us. So powerful, that we didn&#8217;t even comprehend what we were really doing.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      It was until much later that I appreciated and understood the significance of that first experience. It dawned on me that, in the worst case scenario, I could have been charged with invasion of private property and given a permanent record. Strangely, this did not seem very important to me. What impresses me, still to this day, is the fact that I unknowingly shared an experience with many people that have found the pleasure of exploring the decay.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      Discovering and being in abandoned places is something that has been done since the first explorers found remnants of other cultures. The mystery of what happened to the original owners is rarely solved in its entirety, and paradoxically, this is something that makes it more enjoyable. Accepting that you will never know for sure what happened is at the same time, frustrating and fascinating.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      For some people, being in ruins is a horrifying experience and it is easy to understand the reason. Ruins and abandoned places are traditionally served as the scenarios of past catastrophes, invasions, conquests, death or just stagnation to the point of desertion. After all, either the original owners died, or they just did not want to be there anymore for some reason, and sometimes they wanted to leave so quickly and they did not mind leaving their belongings behind. This makes you think that you should follow their example and leave as soon as possible.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      However, for some of us, these places are brimming with history, and even if we never know the full story, we can always picture what happened by letting our minds run wild and fill the blanks with deduction and imagination. For us, the fear is replaced by wonder. Walking trough an abandoned place without disturbing it is an almost sacred ritual, like preserving the memories and testament of those who came before us, while hoping that those who will come after us will do the same.

      Then I discovered that I was not alone in such an strange fascination. The urban explorers have been doing this for many years.
