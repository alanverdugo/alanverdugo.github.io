<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I&#8217;ve been wanting to talk about this from a long time ago.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Lately, I&#8217;ve noticed a trend in men that simply do not care about their appearance.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Dressing well is an advantage that very few men use.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I do not dress well. The other guys dress
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  -Dress according to your fit.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  -Dress according to your age.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  -Dress according to the situation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    I&#8217;ve heard (and, more importantly, I used to say) all of these excuses:
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    -They don&#8217;t care about how I dress in my job/school/social circles.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    -I&#8217;m too busy, I don&#8217;t have time to dress up every morning.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    -I don&#8217;t have to impress anybody. They need to accept me as I am, otherwise they are being intolerant/superficial. I am a beautiful unique snowflake and social norms don&#8217;t apply to me.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    -I can&#8217;t find clothes that fit my body.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
        I am thin, so you would think I have it easy, but the problem here is that I am really <em>really</em> thin. I am also above average stature, so it is really hard to find clothes that fit me well, pants either fit my waist and are too short for my legs, or are long enough but are too wide. This has been a major problem for me because I live in a country where the average male of my age is several sizes bigger than me. So, I actually came to the conclusion that it is even harder for me to find clothes my size than for an overweight person. Suits are specially hard to find. However, we live in the 21st century. I guarantee that you can find clothes in the internet that will fit you perfectly. And even if you don&#8217;t, there are always tailors. Find a good tailor and get your clothes done there, this has been a common practice for hundreds of years which only now sounds unusual thanks to the advent of mass-produced clothing.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    -I prefer to use comfortable clothes.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Everybody does. Nice clothes don&#8217;t have to be uncomfortable.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    -Dressing well is for sissies, gays and metrosexuals. I am a real man, and men are supposed to look tough, women like it that way.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    -I always dress very informally, they&#8217;ll make fun of me if I start using fancy clothes.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Yes, they&#8217;ll make fun of you. But guess what? Some people are just looking for <em>any</em> excuse to make fun of you. I&#8217;ll recommend to get away from that kind of people, but that is a very long and different subject.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    -I need to get in shape before I start dressing properly.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
        No, you don&#8217;t. The hard truth is that, for some people, getting in shape could take months or even years. And then there&#8217;s the situation of &#8220;how fit&#8221; you want to get. Maybe you want to get the body of a body sculptor, and that will take even longer and requires an insane amount of time and dedication. Compared to that, dressing properly can be done much faster, easily, and cheaper. Also, dressing well can be the confidence boost that you need to finally do exercise, eat healthy and eventually get fit. Saying that you need to get fit in order to dress properly is like saying that you need to get a mansion before you clean your room.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Even if you never get fit, there are many people that dress well and don&#8217;t have &#8220;perfect&#8221; bodies. A good style can be accomplished by any person, regardless of body type, age, color, preferences, or economic standing, and when any person can do it, you just don&#8217;t have an excuse.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    -I rarely go outside, I don&#8217;t have to do this.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    -I just don&#8217;t like the style that the fashion industry tries to impose. I can&#8217;t find clothes that I actually like.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    -I don&#8217;t know which style suits me best.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Of course you don&#8217;t! Nobody does at the beginning. Styles are always changing and it is very difficult or even impossible to finally settle to a style that you like and makes you look good. However, you are not alone on this. Call a good female friend (not your mom) as ask her if she can go shopping with you. She will love the idea. Ask her to give you pointers and tell you if the clothes that you try on actually look good on you. Tell her what you like and what you don&#8217;t like, but ask for recommendations, and make sure to have an open mind. Go to different stores and try different styles. Afterwards, buy her dinner and thank her for her help. Repeat this every time you want to buy new clothes or want to change your style. She will be happy to do it.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
        What? You don&#8217;t have any good female friends? Don&#8217;t worry, ask advice to the people working at each store. Most of the time, they are so bored that they will gladly help you and give you really good advice. The drawback of this is that they sometimes tell you that everything looks good on you, just because they want to sell everything to you. If you think they are not being honest, get out of the store or look for somebody else.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Go to fashion sites and look for styles that you like (see previous excuse). Go to the movies and see the clothes the actors are wearing, make notes of which styles you like and they kind of clothes they use to achieve that style. Try to find an actor that has your body type or looks like you (a little bit, at least). Look for pictures of him and see which clothes he his using in different situations. Most of the actors have personal style advisers which tells them what to do and what not to do, you can &#8220;steal&#8221; these suggestions by just looking and what he wears and trying to apply it to you. And no, you don&#8217;t have to spend the same money he does in clothes in order to imitate the style, refer to the next excuse.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    -I don&#8217;t have the money/time/patience to find and buy good clothes.
