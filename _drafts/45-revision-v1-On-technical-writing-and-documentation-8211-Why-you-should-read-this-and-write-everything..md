  I once had one of the top IT companies contacting me about an available position. I thought they wanted me to join their group of programmers since I was looking for a programming gig at the time. But, in fact, they wanted me to be one of their new &#8220;technical writers&#8221;.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Technical writer? Those were two words that I have never heard together before. To me, being a writer meant poems, songs and bards. I have experience in the technical field, and some experience writing, but I never thought of joining those two fields, and specially not as a career. Simply, I was unaware of the existence of such activities.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  But technical writers are not mythical creatures. They do exist, they are badly needed, and they, as I found out later, have very interesting jobs.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Their duties vary from organization to organization, but basically, they are responsible of writing, maintaining, updating, proof-reading and presenting documentation for every piece of software the company has, and, in some cases, doing the same for books and manuals that the company sells to the general public.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  On my quest to learn more about technical writing I learned valuable things:
</p>

<li style="text-align: justify;">
  They do not only use Word, VI, Notepad, Sublime or WYSIWYG editors, those tools simply are not enough when you edit bast amounts of information and also need to present it in a beautiful form to the readers. The tools of the trade here are
</li>

<li style="text-align: justify;">
  They are the people who write and edit those long and expensive certifications books. In fact, many technical writers came from an editorial background in non-technical books, or viceversa, some technical writers later pursue a career as fiction writers or editors.
</li>

<li style="text-align: justify;">
  They use Control Version Systems like Subversion or Git to store and manage the different versions of their documents. This is a fantastic idea, since it allows them to check differences between large files easily and quickly. This practice also allows them to easily approve, rollback and check changes, which is something that happens frequently.
</li>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The more I researched about the position the more I was interested in fulfilling it. I also noticed that, in fact, I was already doing technical writing as a programmer in the form of troubleshooting tutorials, training guides, user manuals, help files and detailed emails directed to other programmers, customers, business analysts and upper management.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I also realized the importance of such documents,
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Documentation should be updated as soon as it is needed, and it is needed very frequently. Otherwise, there is no point in doing any documentation in the first place. An improperly updated document could be worse that no document at all, since it could be misleading and provide misinformation.
