<p style="text-align: justify;">
      Like many people, I got this game totally free as an apology from Sony, after the PlayStation Network service was interrupted. As I had not played any <em>WipEout</em> game before, I choose <em>WipEout HD Fury</em> as one of my free downloads based only on the graphical aspect, and, to be honest, I am very happy to have chosen it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      I am ashamed to admit that, before playing this game, I always thought that the <em>WipEout</em> franchise only was a cheap copy of <em>F-Zero</em>. I was very happy to be proven wrong. I didn&#8217;t know that a racing game could offer so much, and to top it all, I got all this for free.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      <em>WipEout HD</em> offers several game modes: Race campaign, Single race, Tournament, Time trial, Speed lap, and Zone.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      In the <em>Zone</em> races, your ship accelerates by itself gradually and the goal is to survive as long as possible. Is sounds simple, but it is very hard and, more importantly, very addictive. In a game with really good graphics, this mode is particularly gorgeous and shows off the talent of the designers of <a href="http://www.thedesignersrepublic.com/" target="_blank">The Designer&#8217;s Republic</a>. The normal aspect of the tracks changes to something very reminiscent of the <em>Tron</em> bike races and every time the players completes a set of laps, the colors change in a very flashy way. In my opinion, this is by far the most interesting mode in the game. It requires patience, lightning-quick reflexes, and endurance. Watching a good run in the last zones is something really spectacular.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      The <em>Fury</em> expansion adds the following modes: Eliminator, Zone battle and Detonator. As you can imagine, <em>Fury</em> focuses on combat and destruction rather than in a traditional race mode.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      The online mode deserves special recognition. I have ran many times in the online mode, including 8-player tournaments and I have never experience any kind of lag, even on my third-world internet connection. All of my online races have been as smooth as the offline races. This is something notable due to the neck-breaking speed characteristic of the game.    The online community is keeping strong and constant even to this date. I&#8217;ve never had a problem to find opponents in any time of the day or night, which is also notable for such an old game. It was even relatively easy setup a <em>&#8220;Bling Brigade&#8221;</em> race (a race which requires 8 simultaneous players to use a special silver paint-job in their ships).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      WipEout has always had a very special relationship with music (for example, the disc of the first game could be inserted on a regular CD player in order to listen to the game&#8217;s soundtrack). In <em>WipEout HD</em>, the player can change the soundtrack for any songs in the PS3 hard drive. This is a very welcome bonus for those of us who are not fans of electronic music, which is so prevalent in the game.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      This game alone made me a fan of <em>WipEout</em>, The Designer&#8217;s Republic and the Sony Liverpool studio (even thought Sony decided to terminate the studio). I really regret not playing the other games before, but I am thankful to whoever hacker the PlayStation Network, because otherwise I could have gone without playing <em>WipEout</em>.
