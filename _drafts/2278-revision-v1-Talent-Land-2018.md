  The DataLab community gave me a pass to the recent Talent Land event. While I was only able to attend for one day, the experience was overall fun and rewarding.

    The bad stuff
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    There were too many people in the event that just didn&#8217;t know what they were doing. For example, many of the attendants were elementary school students who were forced to go on a school trip.

  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    There were too many booths for non-tech companies, like Coca-Cola, which just shows up to any event they can. Meanwhile, many IT companies were surprisingly absent, and this is even more surprising because I know they have local offices. I am talking about companies like Oracle, Intel, HP, Wizeline, Luxoft, Ooyala. I don&#8217;t know why they didn&#8217;t attend, but I seriously hope it was not because Coca-Cola and the others took their places.
