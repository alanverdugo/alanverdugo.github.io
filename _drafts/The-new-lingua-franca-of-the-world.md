  Every language offer advantages and disadvantages. Some of them are easier to learn, some are easy to pronounce, some offer an advantage in the academic or business worlds. The usage of a language outside of the area where it was created varies greatly and it is a consequence of various factors. Invasions and conquests tend to spread the victor&#8217;s language to the subjected territory. Geographic and topological aspects could help with this expansion or limit it severely.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For the first time in human history and thanks to the world network, a language has the opportunity to officially become the official language of the world.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Currently, English is positioned to become the lingua franca of the world. The economic position of the United States . In a world that runs on computers, the fact that most programming languages are in English further helps the.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  However, it seems another language already won that race.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Binary is &#8220;spoken&#8221; by approximately XXXX devices and, thanks to the Internet, many of them are connected and constantly communicating between them. Not only that, but this number is increasing rapidly. This number is much greater than the human population. If we would think of these devices as inteligent beings, we would notice that the lingua franca of the world is not English or Chinese, but the binary system.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In Animatrix&#8217;s Second Renaissance, we see an independent robot nation that attempted to use diplomacy to be accepted in the UN. They were rejected even when they made the effort to join peacefully and even use human-like robot ambassadors in a failed attempt to maybe awake some sense of empathy in the humans. However, 01 (the robot nation) was an economic powerhouse, due to it being extremely efficient and organized. They were a whole country of permanently interconnected citizens, workers and soldiers. When any of them wanted to communicate to any other, it could achieve it by just thinking about it. They stopped being part of the &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things" target="_blank">Internet of things</a>&#8221; and became the first &#8220;Internet of beings&#8221;. They were the perfect hive-mind. Their most powerful weapon was a common, fast, efficient and simple language. This allowed them to flawlessly coordinate every single action they took and, eventually, win the war against the humans.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  All this begs the question, what would happen with human languages if events like these happen? What would the humans speak if we were subjected to the robots&#8217; rule? Would the robots still deal with the inaccuracy and bast imperfections of human languages or make us all speak in binary? As hard as speaking binary would be for a human, what if we have no choice?
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Plus, if the robots win, we&#8217;ll have to listen to techno.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  What if they are not robots, but beings from another planet? After all, if we make contact with a
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Their language could not even be spoken, but it could be telepathic (like it is in so many science fiction stories) or it could be a behaviour-driven language like the ones bees or ants use.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  And what if both scenarios happen? What would happen if beings from another planet arrive to an Earth governed by robots? Would both parties communicate in binary? How hard would it be for the aliens to learn binary? Chances are, at least their own machines would already use binary and the communication would be easy.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The 1996 film Independence Day has been criticized for being inaccurate in many aspects, and mainly for the scene where a computer virus is uploaded to the alien mothership&#8217;s computer. For any individual with a basic understanding of computer&#8217;s architecture, the idea seems ridiculous. After all, the alien computer would have to be running some kind of operative system compatible with (and exploitable by) the virus&#8217; code. The writers saved some face by saying that human technology was based on the technology found in the alien fighter shipÂ  found in the 1950s, which explains the compatibility problem. However, nobody seems to notice that both the human and alien computer were &#8220;speaking&#8221; binary between them and that this is not far-fetched at all. After all, binary is the perfect language for a machine, so chances are, all the computers in the universe will use it in some way or form.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This movie also offers a glimpse of a communication problem between different races. In Independence Day, the aliens communicate trough brainwaves, so a captured alien has to use the body of a dead human in order to produce sounds understandable by humans. Being an alien, it must look so primitive and funny to see an &#8220;intelligent&#8221; race using vocal cords and a mass of meat in the mouth in order to produce soundwaves in the air.
