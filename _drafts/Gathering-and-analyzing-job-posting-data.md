  Inspired by <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/lNBXj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post in Imgur</a>, I decided to start researching which new skills are being sought after in the laboral market. After all, it has become increasingly important to stay current with the required knowledge. Basically, the Imgur post talks about how to prepare a resume in order to include key words that search engines are looking for before any recruiter actually pays attention to the applicant. At first I did not really believe that this was necessary, but then I saw that the job openings at Google clearly state: &#8220;For immediate consideration, please send a text (ASCII) or HTML version of your resume to <a href="mailto:jobs@google.com?subject=Google%20for%20Work%20Technical%20Solutions%20Engineer,%20Google%20Applications%20-%20Tokyo">jobs@google.com</a>.&#8221;. That fully convinced me. After all, the corner stone of the Google empire is their search algorithm. If they request a plain text resume for immediate consideration, it probably means that some kind of analysis is done, and they want it to be in plain text format so that analysis is done easier and more accurately.

  I wanted to improve my resume, but I did not want to do it manually. I wanted to write code that could automate all this. My main objectives were:
</p>

<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Automate the search of jobs that could be of interest to me.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Get all the descriptions of those job openings and analyze them in order to see which words are more prevalent.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Get email reports sent to me when an particularly interesting position is found. There are alert services that do this for you, but I wanted to do this on my own and without providing my email address to anybody.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Get emails reports sent to me including all the prevalent words that were found for positions that I could be interested. This could help me to improve my resume.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Use all that data to find patterns and help me to get insights.
</li>

Since I have been playing and working with REST APIs lately, I

The disappointment with the LinkedIn API.

I admit that LinkedIn has been a powerful ally. I got my current job trough it, have had several offers thanks to it and I honestly think that it is the only social network that is not a complete waste of time. That is the reason why it was my first choice and I started looking for an LinkedIn API. And I did <a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find it</a>, but it turned out to no be very useful to me.
