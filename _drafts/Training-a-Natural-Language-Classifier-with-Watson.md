  A Natural Language Classifier, as its name implies, is a mechanism tasked with interpreting natural expressions and assigning classes to them. This is the first step into providing answers to these questions, which will then create a good experience where humans try to interact with AIs and robots.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Humans do not like to change they way they talk in order to be understood. We are too used to talk to people because, until now, we only had to talk to people. We want to perform requests like we always do, and we expect a fast, correct and clear answer within the correct context. This, of course, is not something that a computer can easily do. Since our early childhood we had to be trained for years in order to speak correctly and to understand what is being asked to us. Until recent years, we had no opportunity to actually <em>talk</em> to computers, we only <em>interacted</em> with them in more artificial ways, like typing commands, or using pointing devices.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Google, very probably the most used web service in the world, is regarded by most people as very easy to use. But, trough the years, we have learned how to use Google. Any normal user knows that using long sentences with common words will not result in the results we want. For example, we know that a search like &#8220;give me all wallpapers with little pugs in them, please&#8221; will not provide results as good as this search: &#8220;pug wallpaper IMAGESIZE: +1024&#215;768&#8221;. It is not that you cannot get good results with a natural language search, but it would be almost a coincidence based on factors like the actual text content that the Google algorithm parses. In other words, we as humans still need to oversimplify our requests to make it easier for Google to understand what we really want.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  A <em>natural</em> interaction with AIs is required before they are accepted and used by the general population.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Apple&#8217;s Siri, Microsoft&#8217;s Cortana and Amazon&#8217;s Echo have tried to improve this, with varying degrees of success. In January 14, 2011. IBM&#8217;s Watson made history by beating it&#8217;s human opponents on <em>Jeopardy!</em>. It managed to understand the requests from a human voice which used natural expressions, understand their meaning, look for the most appropriate answer and finally articulate the result also as a natural, spoken expression.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Enter Watson.

      Thanks to Watson and Bluemix, we can easily create a Natural Language Classifier, and depending on how much we use it, it can also be free (as in free beer).

      You can use a little demo <a href="http://natural-language-classifier-demo.mybluemix.net/" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Log in into <a href="http://www.bluemix.com" target="_blank">Bluemix</a> (obviously, you will need to create an account if you do not have one already.)

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Go to the Catalog and select the Natural Language Classifier service.
