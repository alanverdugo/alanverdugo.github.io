  One day, Kirby was about to eat a piece of strawberry cake when suddenly it was stolen. Blind with fury, Kirby goes berserk and starts eating and/or beating the shit out of every creature in the galaxy until he find his cake. It seems every Kirby game starts like this. But we honestly don&#8217;t care, we only care about good old 2D action and Kirby is the best at that. Kirby is an unstoppable force of destruction. Leave it to Nintendo to design a fluffy pink ball who is, undoubtedly, also the most powerful and bloodthirsty character in the videogame industry. Let&#8217;s remember that time when he tore a star in half with one punch just because he was bored.

  This game is very short and very easy. It can easily be completed in one day, even finding all of the hidden bonuses. The secret areas, treasures and abilities are very easy to find and grant even more power to Kirby, which makes the game even easier. It is one of the few modern Kirby games which does not require, or at least minimizes, the use of the touchscreen and focuses on just pure bloody 2D side-scrolling killing and destruction, like in the old days. This is greatly appreciated. However, the mini-games are disappointingly boring and they do make unnecessary use of the touchscreen.

  Overall, Kirby Squeak Squad is a fun game, with nice graphics, nice tunes and great control, but it offers little content and replay value. I would recommend it to little kids (regardless of the violent story) or if you find it in the bargain bin and you need a quick Kirby fix, but in any case, the DS remake of Kirby Super Star is better in pretty much every aspect.
