      In the future, there will be AI assistants and counselors for every human task, like Cortana is for Master Chief in his Mjolnir armor, like Ziggy in Quantum Leap, like J.A.R.V.I.S. helps Tony Stark in his lab and from inside the Iron Man armor, like the Icarus in Sunshine, like &#8220;The old man in the cave&#8221; helps the starving citizens in the eponymous episode of <em>The Twilight Zone</em>, and like ADA in Zone of the Enders. A smart enough AI running in a powerful system could help a massive number of concurrent users, learning every time and gaining valuable knowledge from mistakes. These AIs would be the cheapest, smartest, and most valuable &#8220;outsourced&#8221; &#8220;employee&#8221;. Outsourcing so much that these tasks would be performed not even by humans, who, in turn, would use their time in much more rewarding and creative activities. With the rise of Employee as a Service, a virtual employee could join the ranks of any organization in a matter of seconds, without the need of health insurance, benefits, perks, holidays, and even rest or food. An organization could even &#8220;hire&#8221; more AIs to help instantly, if they are having an exceptional good season and they suddenly need more helping &#8220;hands&#8221;. The dreadful firing process would be equally instantaneous, and the depressing firing meetings would be avoided, replaced by a few clicks. The hiring and firing process in the future would be as automated as the request of more infrastructure has been automated thanks to the cloud technologies of today. For instance, an AI could work as a system administrator, fixing problems in the IT infrastructure without the need of a human peer, maybe only requesting help with more advanced problems and when the learning process is in the initial steps.
