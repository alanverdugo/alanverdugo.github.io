<p style="text-align: justify;">
  A mobile touch application to study star constellations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Stars are displayed and the user links them with lines using the touch screen until the constelation is formed correctly. Then, the applications shows data about the constellation (star names, origin, family, ascension, declination, quadrant, etc.)
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The application can show the lines briefly and then the user attempts to form the connections again. This can be configurable. It&#8217;s main purpose is to help the user to remember the constellations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The application can also take a picture of the night sky and try to identify any constellations in the picture.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The application can also offer &#8220;challenges&#8221; like &#8220;take a picture of this constellation tonight!&#8221;, etc.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The user can also create fictitious constellations (with or without real stars) and share them.
</p>
