      I like to see Rorschach&#8217;s mask as the filter he uses to see the world and evaluate the things that happen in it.

      I think that, at the end of the book, Rorschach is actually confused at what Ozymandias did. Ozymandias killed millions (a bad thing) but he saved billions (a good thing). So, for Rorschach, Ozymandias is right and wrong at the same time. Rorschach does not accept this, he must evaluate everything by being right or wrong, white or black. He chooses to say that Ozymandias was wrong, but I think he is not absolutely sure of his decision, so he prefers to die than to live in a world that is somehow&#8230; gray, the world that Ozymandias created by fulfilling his plan. I think Ozymandias showed that nothing is absolutely wrong or absolutely right, and he did this in the most blatant way, so Rorschach was forced to face (eh) this, he did not accept that his most important belief maybe was wrong and he just could not take it.

      Rorschach indeed sees the world in black and white. His mask is a reference to this, he either thinks something is good or bad, black or white.
