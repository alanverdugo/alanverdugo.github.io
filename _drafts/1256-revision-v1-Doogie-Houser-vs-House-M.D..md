House:

Nice scrubs kid, did your mom dress for Halloween?

You are way too young, and I&#8217;m not a pediatrician

so let&#8217;s get this over with

The doctor is in,

I will consume you like a bottle of Vicodin

You may be smart, but you have no experience

teenage drama

You will obey, the House rules!

Doogie:

Personal journal of Doogie Houser M.D.:

I am a genious, I already achieved more than you

but also the better M.C.

You think you&#8217;re funny and sarcastic,

but you always fail at first with your so-called diagnostics

You are everything a doctor should not be

lupus

A broken clock is right twice a day
