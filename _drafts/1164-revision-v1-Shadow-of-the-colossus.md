  This is the game that is always mentioned on <a href="http://press.etc.cmu.edu/content/shadow-colossus-nick-fortugno" target="_blank">discussions</a> about videogames being considered an art form.

  The game makes you feel like an insect that must fight against giants. You could see it as a XX century version of the old fantasy tales abous giants being slain by boys.

  There is a lonely atmosphere permeating <em>Shadow of the colossus</em>. Just you and your loyal horse travelling around gorgeously fantastic and misterious settings. After all, this is the forbidden land, a place intentionallly devoid of people. Interestingly, the limited amount of enemies, music, and even story makes this a profound introspective experience. The minimalistic nature of the game is what really defines it. There is only objective: Destroy the colossi to save a loved one. There is literally nothing to distract you from this, no tutorials, no minigames, no gimmicks, no online mode, nothing. It is as if the protagonist is so obsessed with saving her that it does not even care about anything else anymore. This subtlely implies a sense of urgency to advance the story, and also communicates the complete lack of obedience for commandments and the full commitment to sacrifice everything in the name of love. This is one of the great accomplishments of this game, it puts you in the place of a person that does not care about being considered a sinner, a thief, a murderer, an apostate or a monster if it means saving the life of the one you love. It is truly a beautiful and humbling experience that everybody should feel at least once.

  The misterious ruins and neglected places only generate more questions about past events and the true meaning of this place, for instance, what caused people to consider it a cursed place, if the story hides important information and what really are the colossi. All these questions are in one way or another related to true human stories and legends, which makes the game even better if the player know where to look for clues. And more importantly, you instinticly know that you will not get answers to many of these questions, and this only makes the game more misterious and interesting.

  The settings feel abandoned and ancient, exploring the locations feel like treaspasing to a sacred place. Even the name of the protagonist (Wander)
