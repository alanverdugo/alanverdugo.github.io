  Reading a RSS feed is like reading the front page of a very organized newspaper. A newspaper that updates itself every minute.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  As a user of RSS, I can start my browser and be updated in all the important news in a couple of minutes. More importantly, I can do that again every few hours to know if something new has happened, and doing it will only take me another minute. This is a great help inÂ  my productivity since I can still be aware of everything that is happening but it just requires a fraction of the time it used to take before I started using feeds. Before using feeds, I browsed trough the news pages aimlessly, wasting my time aimlessly as well.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  There was controversy when Firefox 4 launched and suddenly the RSS button was demoted to a second-class citizen. According to Mozilla, the reason behind that decision was that <a href="https://heatmap.mozillalabs.com/">only 3% of the users actually clicked on it</a>. This proves my point, RSS is the most useful thing nobody uses.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  You could argue that the subscribing functionality still exists in Firefox (the difference being that now the users need to navigate trough the menu in order to subscribe to a page) but the decision of removing the button from the address bar will only prevent more people to get familiar with the feed mechanism. After all, I discovered how useful RSS is just because I was curious about that little orange icon.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Worst of all, the number of web designers that add a RSS button to their designs is decreasing, as is the number of back-end programmers that actually implement a RSS feed in the page to begin with.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Without RSS, I would have to go to my news pages and look for the news. I have noticed that this is very distracting. With RSS, the news come to me, and they are waiting there to be read. I can choose when I want to visit a site in order to read further.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  And this brings the question: are RSS feeds bad for a website? After all, if I have to actually go to a site in order to read the headlines, it is much more likely that I will read more articles, click on banners and spend more time browsing the site, which directly or indirectly affects the site&#8217;s income. In this sense, for a webmaster, feed reading is like window-shopping, when the user could instead enter the store and be subjected to a much more complete marketing experience.
