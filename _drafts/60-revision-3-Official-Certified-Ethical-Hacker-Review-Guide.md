    This is a study guide for the Certified Ethical Hacker certification test.

  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    The book does not attempt to go into deep detail in any of the topics, this is not the goal of the book since CEH is one of the most basic security certifications available today.

  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    In the test exam, the wording of some of the questions is very misleading. I found some questions that have multiple correct answers where only one is supposed to be correct. I have not taken the CEH exam yet, but I am worried that these kind of errors also occur in the real test. This problems is not so bad to cause an erroneous failure of the real test, but it is a problem that hopefully will be solved in the future editions of this book.
