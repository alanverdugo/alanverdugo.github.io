  Thanks to my good friend Avena, I have read <a href="http://www.gereports.com/post/91250246340/lettuce-see-the-future-led-lighting-helps-farming" target="_blank">the story</a> about GE and a company that is changing lettuce farming in Japan. The name of this company is Mirai and it has optimized the production of lettuce with indoor farms, which are currently producing 10,000 heads of lettuce a day, which is 100 times more than a regular farm, while using 99% less water and reducing waste by 40%.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This is a great leap forward for agriculture, but I think this represents much more than anybody else has realised yet. I believe we can improve this idea further and solve many of the world&#8217;s problem in one quick stroke.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For starters, not only
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  1 &#8211; Farms will no longer need to be far from urban areas.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In the future, farms will be located underground. I can see supermarkets having their own production line under the supermarket itself, and only paying for the transportation of products that cannot be produced in underground facilities.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  2 &#8211; Farms will relocate according to our needs.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  3 &#8211; We will get fresh produce and it will be faster and cheaper.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  4 &#8211; It will have a profound impact on the economy.
