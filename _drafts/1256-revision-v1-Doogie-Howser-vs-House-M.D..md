House:

Nice coat kid, did your mom dress for Halloween?

You are way too young, and I&#8217;m not a pediatrician

so let&#8217;s get this over with

The doctor is in,

I will end you like a bottle of Vicodin

You may be smart, but you have no experience

teenage drama

You will obey, the House rules!

You are trying to hard to follow your dad steps.

You&#8217;re not old enough to play,

but you will learn, that the House always wins

&nbsp;

Doogie:

Personal journal of Doogie Howser M.D.:

I am a genius, I already achieved more than you

but also the better M.C.

prepare to feel my Doogie style.

You think you&#8217;re funny and sarcastic,

but you always fail at first with your so-called diagnostics

You are everything a doctor should not be

lupus

A broken clock is right twice a day
