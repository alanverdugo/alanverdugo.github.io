      Growing up in the 90s as a mexican kid was an interesting experience. Back then, videogames were not translated to spanish or other languages as they are now. In America (and I mean the whole continent), you could only buy videogames in English, so as a little kid trying to play you only got two options: Learn English or just play action games with little or no dialog. Learning English was certainly not impossible but it was very difficult. Mexican public elementary schools simply did not have English classes or resources, and getting a private tutor was simply out of the financial capabilities of most families. So, action games were all the rage. Mario, Duck-hunt, Punch-out, Contra, and all the others were sought after, carefully loaned and frequently stolen. RPGs were rare and obviously not very popular.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      Metroid and Megaman were special cases. They can be played from beginning to end without much reading, but they used passwords as a way to continue gameplay. Back then I did not know what a &#8220;password&#8221; was or how they worked, and the manuals were unhelpful, since they were also completely in English. I was unaware that you could turn off your NES and continue at a later time. I honestly thought that Metroid and Megaman were meant to be played from beginning to end in one playtrough. Being born in a poor family also meant that leaving the NES turned on for days (or even hours) was strictly forbidden, I was lucky to have a NES to begin with. So there I was, unknowingly playing hardcore speedruns of most games just because I was unaware of the concept of &#8220;saving&#8221;. It was like playing all the games in an hidden difficulty setting. I would invite any person who only speaks English to get a Japanese RPG and see how far he or she can make it before it all gets frustrating and hopeless. That is what we went trough. And we went trough that because it was our only choice. I often dreamed about working for a videogame company and making games in my mother language, but that dream seemed too unachievable and ambitious to a poor mexican kid.

      Obviously, I had no access to the Internet to ask for help or guidance, and even if I had, most of the Internet is in English anyway. My father, who did speak English, never thought of helping me, not because he didn&#8217;t want to, but because he never thought that I needed help. For him, videogames were something that you could enjoy for a few minutes and without any English knowledge, like Pong or Pac-man.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      Then came Kirby&#8217;s adventure, a very special case. It was one of the few NES games that had an integrated battery. This meant that your progress could be saved and you did not need a password. More importantly, your progress was saved automatically, so there was no need for special menus or selecting specific options. Better yet, you could do this in three separate save files. I did not know how it worked, but I just knew that I could stop playing and continue days later, exactly where I left. It may sound silly, but for a six-year old that was like magic. Kirby&#8217;s adventure quickly became my favorite game and it was the first game that I completed.

      As the years went on, I slowly started learning English and understanding a few words scattered among all the gibberish. I ironically found the English classes in junior high-school very boring. They only talked about how to find hypothetic libraries and I just wanted to understand how to save the virtual worlds once I got home. I then started playing more complex games, like The Legend of Zelda: Link&#8217;s awakening and Chrono Trigger. Playing these games was much more useful than the English classes. They immersed me in worlds where I absolutely needed to understand what was going on, otherwise me and every other pixelated person would die. So, for me, it was serious business. I can only imagine how the characters in videogames would have reacted if they could notice that the only hero that can save the world cannot even understand what they said. That is as tragic as it is funny. This was the equivalent of moving to a different country where you don&#8217;t speak the language and there are no translators. As people who have done this can tell, you learn the language very quickly, due to necessity.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Pokémon Red and Blue was one of the few games that got a re-release in Spanish.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      I then started noticing an unsurprising pattern among my schoolmates. The ones that grew up playing videogames where much better at the advanced English classes. This is an unexpected and unintended positive effect of the lack of regard to non-english speaking children in the 80s and 90s. For those of us who knew how to take advantage of it, gave us the upper hand in an important part of our education, and eventually, in the job market. I&#8217;ll let that sink in for those who complain about violence or lack of education in videogames.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This is Power Quest, it had a literal translation to Spanish.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      Sporadically appeared some games with multi-language options, sadly, most of them where badly translated or had literal translations that were even more confusing than reading it in another language. Now, you can download hacked ROMs of some old games that have all (or some of) the text translated, mainly from Japanese to English. But this is a solution that arrives too late for most of us.

      Years later, I did end up working for an US videogame company. A position I gladly left when I learned that the videogame industry is more stressful delivery dates than fairytales. However, things are better now and most companies launch their games in several languages at once, including variations like European Spanish and Latin-american Spanish, and they are not just text translations anymore, many games now have multiple voice tracks fully dubbed for their respective markets. I now wonder what will happen to this new generation of gamers, who have played all their videogames in their native language, will this advantage prove to be a disadvantage in the future? I guess we will need to wait and see.
