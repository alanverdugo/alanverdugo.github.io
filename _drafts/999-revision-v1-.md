  The story
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  One day, Kirby was about to eat a piece of strawberry cake when suddenly it was stolen. So obviously Kirby goes berserk and starts eating and/or beating the shit out of every creature in the galaxy.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Kirby is an unstoppable force.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Leave it to Nintendo to design a fluffy pink ball who is, undoubtedly, also the most powerful and bloodthirsty character in the videogame industry. Let&#8217;s remember that time in the SNES era when he destroyed a star in half with one punch just because he was bored.

  The game is very short and very easy. It can easily be completed in one day, even finding all the hidden bonuses. The secret areas, treasures and abilities are very easy to find and grant even more power to Kirby, which makes the game even easier. It is one of the few modern Kirby games which does not involve some kind of touchscreen gimmick and it is just pure bloody 2D side-scrolling killing and destruction.This is greatly appreciated

  Overall, Kirby Squeak Squad is a fun game, with nice graphics, nice tunes and great control, but it offers little content and replay value. I would recommend it to little kids (regardless of the violent story) or if you happen to find it used or in the bargain bin and you need a quick Kirby fix.
