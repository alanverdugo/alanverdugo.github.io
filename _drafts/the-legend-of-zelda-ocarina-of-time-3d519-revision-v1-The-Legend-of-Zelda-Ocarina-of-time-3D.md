      This is the fourth time I buy an edition of this game, and I do not regret it. This alone should be enough to make you buy this game, but let&#8217;s continue with the review, because I do not get paid for one-line reviews.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      Actually, I do not get paid for 100-line reviews either, but what the hell.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      First of all, the graphics look amazing and they show how much more powerful the tiny 3DS is compared to the N64. In fact, the graphics look like the Zelda GameCube demo that was shown in the Spaceworld event back in 2000, which created wet and unfulfilled fantasies for many, many fans, myself included.
</p>



<p style="text-align: justify;">
      Unfortunately, the control scheme suffered a few changes due to the portable nature of the 3DS. There is indeed a big difference between the 3DS and the N64 controller. This game was designed originally with that controller in mind, so there are some things that have changed for the worst. For example, the ocarina (probably the most used item in the game) is assigned permanently to the lower screen, and there is no way to assign it to a button. The directional pad is not used for anything in the entire game, which is a tragedy because it could have been a perfect place to assign four more items. There is no option for changing button layouts or anything that remotely looks like it, which makes this situation even more frustrating.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      One of the right changes that were made was to assign the Hover boots and the Iron boots as normal items instead of gear items, just like they did in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker</em>. This allows the player to equip and unequip them quick and easy with the press of a button instead of navigating trough the menu.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      We can also use the 3DS integrated gyroscope in the first person view mode, so moving the console moves the camera while aiming the slingshot or any other first person items. However, I must confess that I disabled this feature because it is much more accurate to just use the directional stick.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      The <em>Master Quest</em> mode that was released in Japan and in the GameCube promo disc is back in this same cartridge and it is available once a normal playtrough is completed. For those of you that do not know, <em>Master Quest</em> is a special game mode where Hyrule is &#8220;mirrored&#8221; and the dungeons are a little bit different and more difficult. For those who have played <em>Ocarina of Time </em>countless times, this offers a very welcome challenge that breathes a little bit of novelty into an old masterpiece. Other minor extras include a boss rush mode and optional clues that could help novice players save Hyrule.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      This is arguably the best edition of <em>Ocarina of Time</em> we&#8217;ve had, so it may be worth it to visit Hyrule once again. If you are one of those sad people in the world that somehow has not played this game, this is the perfect excuse to finally do it. Grezzo is now working on a similar edition of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#8217;s Mask</em> for the 3DS, and if it looks as good as <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D</em> and they fix the control scheme, it will definitely be another must have game for the 3DS.
