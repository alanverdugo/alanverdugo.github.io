I haven&#8217;t told many people, but I went back to school after several years of graduating.

The few people I did tell, found it weird, funny, or even a bad idea. Some of them saw it as a waste of time.

Essentially, I had these goals:

It had to be completely online. This allowed me to save time in commute, and also allowed me to move cities or even countries if I wanted to do so. This also made it easier since it saved me much time to otherwise would have been wasted behind the wheel or inside public means of transport. People often underestimate this factor.

Continue working. This meant being a full-time student while also being a full-time programmer. It was not easy, there were times when I had to start working on assignments as soon as I finished my daily working hours. I got used to not having much (or any) free time.

To show it is possible. I know I didn&#8217;t need to do this. There have been many people with worse situations that have accomplished more than me. But I wanted to show all those people who complain that it is too hard, and that the government, god, the society or some other mystical figure should help them. I wanted to show them all that I was able to do it, alone. And if I could do it, they have no excuse.

Many of them want a teacher that will sit with them and explain things slowly, like a private tutor. University classes require self-learning and online courses even more, so people need to be able to go out of their way to study on their own and be able to find their own answers.

Was it worth it? Definitively, even if many things
