The protagonist tries to create an &#8220;digital ark&#8221; to save the world. Inside the ark there are two &#8220;trees&#8221;:

-the tree of knowledge, which is a compendium of all the knowledge humankind has gathered (similar to wikipedia)  
-the tree of life, which is a database of the genetic code of all living and extinct beings.

The protagonist(s) faces several problems:

-How to gather the data? (is it enough to get the genetic code of a single human? or do we need ALL of them? how about extinct beings? should the data be gathered by force? should the data be gathered without explicit agreement or permission by the living beings?)  
-How to store the data? (which medium is best for ultra long-term storage? which location(s) should be used to store it?)  
-How to transmit/share the data? (which format would be best for future or even alien beings to easily understand and get the information? how should it be sent? to which destination(s) should it be sent?)
