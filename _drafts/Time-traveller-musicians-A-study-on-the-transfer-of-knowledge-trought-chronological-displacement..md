      Note: The following post reveals important plot points for some works of fiction (namely <em>Back to the future</em>, <em>The legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time</em>, <em>-All of you zombies-</em>, and <em>Universal War One</em>). If you do not mind this, feel free to continue reading. However, I will strongly suggest to first see, play, or read all of the mentioned works, since all of them are very good anyway.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      In <em>Back to the future</em>, Marty McFly goes back in time and plays <em>&#8220;Johnny B. Goode&#8221;</em> in the Enchantment under the sea dance. Chuck Berry listens to the song in the telephone and &#8220;composes&#8221; the same song, which turns out to be a great success, being a popular song at least until the 1980s, when Marty McFly learns to play it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      In <em>The legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time</em>, a young Link plays <em>&#8220;The song of storms&#8221;</em> to the windmill man, who becomes obsessed by it, playing it for seven years, until Link, now older, appears in the windmill again and learns to play the same song, which will allow him to go back in time and teach the song to the man who has just taught the song to him.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      In Robert A. Heinlein&#8217;s story <em>&#8220;-All of you zombies-&#8220;</em>, the protagonist is, at the same time, its own mother and father. (His pen name, is, in fact, &#8220;The unmarried mother&#8221;). Besides giving birth to himself and having sexual intercourse with himself, he is who teaches himself how to travel trough time.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      In Heinlein&#8217;s story, the mere existence of the protagonist is a paradox. He himself is the only entity that took part in his own creation. He did not have any grandparents and will have no descendants (other then himself, of course). One could say he is outside of the wheel of time or the cycle of life, with no blood connections to any other human, or to any other living being. This brings the obvious question: where do his physical characteristics come from? If the generic information is passed down by the parents to their children, where did the protagonist took his genetic information from? The obvious answer would be from himself, but that does not explain why, for example, his eyes are of one colour and not the other. For him, there was never a template from where basic genetic information could be taken. Other than himself of course, but that only postpones the answer to the question of where his generic information really comes from. He is the proverbial ouroboros, the snake eating its own tail.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      The reader will now realize that &#8220;The song of storms&#8221; and &#8220;Johnny B. Goode&#8221; are similar to the protagonist&#8217;s paradoxical existence. These songs were never really composed by anybody in the first place. They were endlessly communicated between two entities, none of them being the original composer of the song. They suddenly appeared in the context of their respective stories, but there was never an actual process of songwritting taking place.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      In Universal War I, a machine is sent to the past, which provides the schematics and teaches the engineers of that time how to construct such a device. <&#8212;&#8212;re-read the comic and elaborate.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      There is a factor of entropy in the information that is transferred in the ontological paradox. For example, Chuck Berry could not perfectly hear the song over the telephone, thus he could have invented some parts of the song, modifying what he heard from Marty McFly. Thus, Marty could have learned this &#8220;new&#8221; modified song in the future, including the modifications and then going back in time and playing -probably with some errors and adaptations- an even more modified song to Chuck. In other words, the song is slowly being corrupted over the course of time travel, like a document being photocopied many times. Sooner or later you end up with a copy of a very low quality. The same happens with &#8220;The song of storms&#8221; and with the genetic information of the &#8220;Unmarried mother&#8221;.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      All of these are works of fiction, but they serve as undeniable proof of the following: We do not know how the transfer of information will work in the event of chronological displacement of a human being.
