  Hello Bill,
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      The purpose of this email is to let you know of philanthropy ideas I&#8217;ve had in the past but that I have been unable to materialize on my own. The reason of such failures have been lack of resources on my part. I would like to have money and a team that could work with me in order to make these ideas come to fruition, but such thing is not possible yet. However, since I think these are really good ideas that could make a positive impact on the world and that you seem the kind of person that could be interested on such things, I wanted to share them with you.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      I do not expect any kind of retribution for the ideas, I honestly only want them to see them fulfilled in order to make a better world for as many people of possible. Having said that, any feedback would be appreciated.
</p>

      First idea: Recently, there have been interesting developments in terms of indoor farming ( http://www.gereports.com/post/91250246340/lettuce-see-the-future-led-lighting-helps-farming ). I propose to setup cargo ships (or any other big ships) with this new technology in order to have &#8220;mobile-farms&#8221; that could be easily deployed to areas where they are needed (for example, areas that have been struck by earthquakes, tsunamis, drought, etc.). While there are no natural disasters to attend to, the ships could be used as &#8220;normal&#8221; farms docked to ports, and they would eventually pay themselves. The crew of the ship could also travel the country (or the world) teaching the basic principles of farming to students or people that needs to have source of income and/or food.

      Second idea: Skin cancer is a easily detectable
