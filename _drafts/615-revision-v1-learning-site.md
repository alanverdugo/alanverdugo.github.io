A site where you can create an account and specify your areas of expertise, like languages, programming, math, cooking, etc.  
The users can provide courses, training and classes to other members of the site via video chats and sharing their screens.  
You can also learn from them in the same way.  
You can specify the cost per minute of your classes, or you can also offer them for free.  
The site will get a small percentage of every monetary transaction.  
After the teachers get many students, this percentage will decrease, so they will be encouraged to get more students.  
After each class, the paypal account or credit card of the student will be charged automatically. (cost per minute * minutes of the video chat)  
Also, after each class, the student can provide feedback to the teacher and to the site. (E.g. Quality of topics, Quality of video/audio, Topic knowledge, etc.)

The users can also submit reviews of the class/course/teacher/student and this should be able to be shared on social networks, like linkedin.  
(E.g.  
&#8220;This class was very useful for my work, the topics were really interesting and easy to follow.&#8221;  
&#8220;The student is very smart and he completed the difficult assignements easily, I recommend her for any job in this area.&#8221;  
&#8220;The Java course was very useful and, after taking it, I was able to pass my certification test very easily.&#8221;)

The users should have an Statistics page were they can see how many hours they have studied per month/day/etc., which topics, how many courses taken, etc.
