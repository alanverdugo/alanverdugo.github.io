  We all have been there, and we all will be there again eventually. Either you have been a trainee or you have been the trainer. People change jobs everyday and they need training, that is one of the facts of life in the workplace.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Regardless of the company, position or experience, a new IT employee usually takes months to become proficient enough to be able to truly fulfill her tasks without help or supervision.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  As a senior member of the team, if you take time from your schedule to train new employees, you are wasting your time.  It sounds cruel, but it is true. Will you or your team personally train every single new employee that comes to your company? After training, do the new employees still require help or have questions? Are you repeating the same training sessions every time? How much of your work is now in the backlog because you spent your time in training sessions?
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Sadly, this is how most companies (even IT companies) conduct their training. It seems very ironic that companies full of brilliant minds that are paid very well to automate things are not automating one of their most basic and crucial tasks.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In fact, you could measure the organization in how much time does a new employee need to be trained, how much time from other members of the team needs to be invested in training the new hires and how much time, after said training, it takes for a new employee to become proficient in his or her duties.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Obviously, some basic training will always be required and no amount of documentation will replace it. New employees still need to know the other members of the team, introductions need to be made, initial setup for their workstations needs to be done and proper accesses need to be granted. There is no way around this. However, once the new hires have access and are pointed to your training resources, they should be able to figure out things by themselves. Your training documentation needs to be clear enough so a new hire with proper access can learn whatever is required for the daily operation of your team.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In one of my jobs, a technical lead had the idea of recording videos our training sessions. It was an amazing idea at the time. After all, I could watch the training videos over and over again until I fully understood my new duties. I could even watch the videos from home and do a little overtime training. It took me a while to understand that this approach had two fatal flaws. Try to identify them before you continue reading.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  First, if <em>anything</em> mentioned in that video changes, the whole video is automatically outdated and could be even be considered as a piece of misinformation. In my case, each training video was, approximately, an hour long. Did a link to a resource change? The video is useless now. A server name changed? The video is useless now. A tool was deprecated? The video is useless now. As a trainer, do you really want to record another hour-long training session just because a little thing changed? After all, your training is, basically, documentation. And as we discussed before (link to technical documentation writing), the most important aspect of documentation is that it needs to remain updated.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The second flaw of the video is that it is a video. If I get a phone call in the middle of the night about a production server or a critical application that is not working properly, I do not want to go trough a series of hour-long videos trying to remember in which exact second the troubleshooting procedure was discussed. In other words, all the documentation needs to be indexed and anybody with proper security clearance needs to be able to search anything in it. You cannot achieve that in a video unless you have a full transcript of all the content, and if you have a transcription, why bother with the video in the first place? In other words, if you really want to create training videos, make sure that they are short, concise and that the content will not need to be updated any time soon.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Ideally, all the training documentation should be:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Easy to find and share.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Available in electronic format.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Secured properly.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Updated constantly and easily.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Available not only to new employees, but to seniors as well so they can keep it updated.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For example, the training documentation should be a guide that is stored in the team&#8217;s documentation system (a private wiki, Confluence, CMS, etc.), and it should include step by step procedures understandable by anybody who does not know anything about the company or its procedures (after all that is the definition of a new employee). It must include examples, links, contacts and even tests or interactive sessions. You should be able to read the training documentation, and after finishing, you should know everything you need to know in order to do your job, without major  interventions from other members of your team.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Valve Software takes a step in the right direction with their <a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/jobs/">handbook for new employees</a>, which is basically a &#8220;Don&#8217;t panic&#8221; manual designed to make the transition easier for new hires trying to find their place in the company. Yes, it is a physical product and thus is subjected to be outdated very quickly, but if you download it and read it, you will notice that it does not have much information that needs to be updated constantly. Which takes me to another point: You can actually download the .pdf from Valve (even if you are not an employee). so Valve can update the .pdf painlessly and distribute it quickly if such need arises.
