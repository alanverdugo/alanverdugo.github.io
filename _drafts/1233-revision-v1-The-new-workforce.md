  Thanks to a number of circumstances, I, very unexpectedly, ended up working on a project related to natural language processing. This has ignited my desire to learn more about machine learning, artificial intelligence and natural interfaces. In turn, this has caused to read articles about novel uses of these technologies. The things I have learned are fascinating. The potential we are are facing in the use of these technologies is basically limitless. The risks, in my opinion, are vastly outweighed by the promises that these technologies tacitly make. However, what really impressed me was not this, but the speed at which these events are happening. We are used to hear that promising technologies will be here in the near future, that the new generation will enjoy a radically different world, or, simply put, that our dreams will come true &#8220;soon&#8221;. We have heard all those phrases one too many times, so we have developed incredulity to them.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  However, I am not here to tell you that the world is going to change soon. I am here to tell you that the world has completely changed and none of you know about it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  People that know about this are already planning for a future where a human workforce is not required. The economic consequences of an automated workforce are already being discussed and some smart people are already offering solutions. One of these solutions is the implementation of an <a href="http://www.universalincome.org/about/" target="_blank">Universal Income</a>, which basically is a salary just for being a live human being. My knowledge of futuristic macro-economics is simply not as good for me to offer a solution or even to differentiate the advantages or disadvantages of such solutions. But the important thing remains. The world is facing such a violent and profound change that it will impact every single aspect of our lives, including the one we usually don&#8217;t want to be changed: our economic status quo.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For the past months, this has been a predominant discussion my mind.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Let&#8217;s take for example my home country, Mexico. Every year, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2271455/Revealed-How-immigrants-America-sending-120-BILLION-struggling-families-home.html" target="_blank">billions of dollars are sent to Mexico</a> by mexican immigrants in the US, in fact, they send so much money that it is estimated to be Mexico&#8217;s number one source of revenue. These immigrants represent a cheap and reliable workforce, so many people in the US are happy to hire them. But what will happen when an even cheaper and more reliable workforce appears? Yes, I am talking about robots smart enough to pick fruits, smart enough to be gardeners and smart enough to do whatever work immigrants are willing to do for a low salary. When (notice I did not write &#8220;if&#8221;) this happens, the US employers will have no problem to stop hiring mexican immigrants and start buying (or leasing) even cheaper robots. And it will be this moment when the mexican economy will be impacted severely. It is just a matter of when, and a matter of being prepared to overcome that obstacle beforehand. If we want to stop or at least diminish this problem, the smart people of Mexico should start working on a solution <em>right now</em>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  That is just one of the many obvious examples. Thanks to autonomous vehicles, the truck drivers in the US are also going be affected, and guess what? they hold the number one spot on the list of job positions in the country. When this amount of people is laid off, the whole country will be affected.
