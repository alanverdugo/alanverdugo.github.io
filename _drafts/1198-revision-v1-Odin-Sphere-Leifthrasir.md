  This feels like a new generation fairy tale, and sometimes it is literally that.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The graphics are absolutely gorgeous. At some moments I just stopped playing the game and stared at the screen to admire such beauty. While playing, I often wondered if the videogame industry jumped into the 3D era too soon, since it is obvious that compelling stories and spectacular gameplay can still be created and enjoyed in pure 2D. I would love to see other great 2D games like <em>Castlevania</em> or <em>Metroid</em> being resurrected with graphics like these.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  But <em>Odin Sphere</em> is much more than its visuals. Under the beautiful exterior lies a fun action-RPG with a solid story and character diversity.

  Ironically, this is were the biggest flaw of the game resides. The price we must pay to have the gorgeous scenery is that most scenarios will repeat many times trough the game. Each small &#8220;room&#8221; connects to another very similar room until you reach the boss, then change to another area where the rooms are quite similar to each other and repeat the process until you switch characters and everything starts again from another point of view and in a different order. For example, one character will start in the snow area and then move to a forest. The next character could start in the forest and then move to the snow area. Even if the backgrounds are basically the same, the map will change for every character, so the areas are not strictly the same even if they look identical, and precisely for this is that I feel a little riped of by such an obvious attempt of recycling the art as much as possible, but at the same time, it is extremely good art that deserves to be used as much as possible.

  In order to add a little more excitement to the stages, some abilities have been cleverly hidden in them. Very similar to the armor capsules in the <em>Megaman X</em> games. The abilities can be enhanced with <em>phozons</em>, which is energy retrieved from fallen foes. The abilities are organized into a three, and to unlock the next branch level points need to be used which is similar to the &#8220;technology trees&#8221; in strategy games, where you need to choose the path you want to follow in order to pursue an ability.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The main story is divided in chapters, and . The characters are different enough to provide variety in the gameplay while still retaining enough similar characteristics to avoid the frustration of feeling that you need to start from scratch every time you switch characters.

  <em>Odin Sphere</em> was originally launched on the PS2, and now the <em>Leifthrasir</em> version is available on the PS3, PS4 and PSVita. Some people complain about companies re-releasing old games in new consoles since it certainly looks like an attempt to sell more copies without putting more effort into a brand new game. But in the case of <em>Leifthrasir</em>, those complaints simply do not apply. This new version fixes problems that the PS2 version had while also adding new options. And, to be honest, re-releasing a new version of such a good game can only mean that more people will be able to enjoy it, which can only be good.

  The cooking and alchemy mechanics are fun. In most RPGs I tend to level up when I have problems beating an enemy or clearing a stage. This generally solves the problem and I don&#8217;t need to pay much attention to item management or procuring the right items. In <em>Odin Sphere</em>, this is different. I quickly noticed that the cooking and alchemy mechanisms are an important, useful, and very fun way to advance in the game.

  The voice acting is surprisingly good. Both Japanese and English dialogues are included and we can switch between them at any moment. I decided to try both and I surprised myself by liking the English track just a little more. Most of the time, English spoken dialogue in videogames sound way too ridiculous and overdone to me, but the great majority of actors in <em>Odin Sphere</em> know how to portray those feelings of respect, love, sadness, fury and determination that are so important for the development of the story.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The combat system is another one of the many good aspects of the game. While some characters are slower than others, they are all capable of long, agile, and rewarding combos. The large number of special attacks and abilities help to increase the hit numbers, which can easily go into the hundreds in a few seconds. In fact, I can confidently say that this RPG has a better fighting system than many modern fighting games.
