      It is baffling that some teams and companies still do not know how to use control versions systems, but it is even more baffling to see that some teams do know about control version systems but decide not to use them. Some prefer to store source code on each of the team members&#8217; workstations and then join the code and work from there. The problems that this &#8220;approach&#8221; brings are many and very grave. For example, one developer could use dependencies that are not needed by the rest of the team, or have a disparity of versions of said dependencies. I have seen such basic and easily avoidable problems like a team member writing her part of the project in one programming language and the rest of the team writing their parts in another language. These kind of mistakes are not even acceptable from students.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      The control version systems were created by developers for developers because they came to the conclusion that the source code (their main deliverable) needs to be properly stored and organized. Trough the years, many different version control systems have been created, with different characteristics between them.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      The following is a list of the advantages that control version systems provide:
</p>

<li style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>Accessibility.</strong> By having the code in a shared server, it is easy for the development team to synchronize and update the code independently of the geographic location of the team.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>Backups.</strong> As the name implies, version control systems are very useful for permanent storage of all the versions of each file, including current and previous versions.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>Collaboration.</strong> The team can collaborate by sharing files (see the first point), but control version systems can also help to easily conduct code reviews, approvals, revisions, updates and rollbacks.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>Troubleshooting.</strong> By having quick and easy access to previous versions of the source code, it is much easier to identify when a change caused problems, who caused it, and exactly when and how the problem was caused. This is very useful for post-mortem investigations in production environments, as well as for the developers&#8217; learning process.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>Flexibility.</strong> Version control systems are not only used for handling code, they are also used by non-developers. I have seen examples of this by technical writers, who use a control version system for collaboration in the writing, preparation and edition of documents and books. People who support applications use it for storage and handling of tutorials, memorandums, guides and even binary files. It would not be weird to see control version systems used by other disciplines like architecture, medicine, and graphic design.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>Popularity.</strong> Every company that handles software seriously is using some kind of version control system. Even companies that only write software for maintaining another kind of operations have seen the advantages that having a good control of their source code means. This is an advantage for the developers and IT professionals that want to work for this kind of companies. Experience and knowledge in control version systems can be a decisive advantage in interviews with this kind of companies.
