Errata: Errors have been found in the following pages: 1 to End.

Dubious information will be printed in the following style: style

History of computing

  * In the beginning, people did not have videogames or social networks, so the popular pastime was to use their computers to calculate missile trajectories for the military. The large size of these ancient computers stopped the programmers to take them home and use them to play videogames.
  * Punched cards. The most elegant and environmentally-friendly way to write computer code at the time. This barely resembles modern programming.
  * 56 kbps modems. (The dial-up connection is a mating ritual) If the mating ritual went fine, the modem (and hence the computer that it was attached to) would be connected to the Internet.
  * Bill Gates and Microsoft
  * Steve Jobs and Apple

The basics

  * Measurement units (kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte, gozillabyte, etc)
  * Acronyms (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association. (Or People Can&#8217;t Memorize Computer Industry Acronyms)
  * In the US, the measurement imperial units are slightly different (1 byte = 1.36 licks, 1 chew = 0.0030 gargles, 1 gargle = 327 libraries of Congress)
  * Flow diagrams (Symbols: Begin, Print, Decision, Stop, Flammable, No U-turn, Pretzel, Cattle crossing, Dangerous dog, This side up, Recycle)
  * Certifications (Certified Ethical Hacker, Certified Scrum Master, Certified Angus Beef)
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_symbol
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road\_signs\_in\_the\_United_States
  * Applications

Hardware

  * Microcomputers, and macrocomputers
  * Processors
  * Keyboards (QWERTY/DVORAK, mechanical keyboards)
  * Tablets (they are just keyboardless laptops)
  * Hard drives
  * Mobile and &#8220;smart&#8221; devices.
  * Printers. The computer industry seemed to have noticed that it was the producer of most of the technological miracles and revolutionary ideas, so they have to balance out the situation by creating something that the world would collectively despise, while also destroying a few million threes in the process.
  * How to take care of your computing device (change oil, machine wash and line dry)
  * Companies (Apple, Raspberry)

Programming

  * Programming languages (Assembly, Bssembly, Cssembly (AKA C)
  * [https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/21ujqu/til\_on\_april\_1\_2007\_google\_sent\_an\_email\_to\_its/](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/21ujqu/til_on_april_1_2007_google_sent_an_email_to_its/)
  * [https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/314zfz/til\_javas\_license\_agreement\_says\_that\_it\_is\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/314zfz/til_javas_license_agreement_says_that_it_is_not/)
  * Hello World (The companion program, &#8220;Goodbye World&#8221; has been banned since the creation of Artificial Intelligence).
  * Algorithms
  * Debugging (Debugging involves getting into the mind of the previous programmer, which is not pretty. Or even worse, getting into your own mind some years ago, which is not pretty and is also cringe-worthy)
  * Programming methodologies (agile, SCRUM, extreme programming, pair programming, cascade)
  * Spaces vs Tabs. Look at the following programs. They are both a &#8220;hello world&#8221; program written in C++. See if you can find the 37 differences. Take as much time as you need and once you find them continue reading. Done? The differences are non-printable characters. Some programmers like to use blank spaces as, well, as blank spaces. But there are programmers who like to use the tab key to insert indentation. Of course, this has created a heated debate among programmers, and nobody seems to agree which is the best option. This is yet another one of the famous holy wars in the computing world. Not only that, there is another debate inside this one, where nobody agree in which many spaces (or the length of the tab) should be used. There are people that say 2, other people say 4 or 8, and some even have the audacity of preferring odd numbers.

The Internet

  * Social networks (MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) &#8211; Twitter is just the poor man&#8217;s blog.
  * Search engines
  * Streaming services
  * The Cloud (Wireless was created to connect to an actual cloud)

Open Source

  * Linux (history, commands, distributions). Linux commands are short for two reasons: First, the limitation of 8 characters and second, it made it easier to remember the names.
  * [https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/6193yr/til\_linux\_is\_called\_linux\_because\_the_sysadmin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/6193yr/til_linux_is_called_linux_because_the_sysadmin/)
  * A genealogical three of Linux distributions (RedHat, BlueDress, WhiteSox, Slackware, Yellow Dog, Android, Debian, Ubuntu, Voodoontu, Damn Small Linux, Big Ass Linux, Arch Linux, Manjaro, Gentoo, YouToo, Voodoontoo, )
  * Licenses

Videogames

  * History of videogames
  * Companies

Security

  * Hackers
  * Protection methods (Passwords, keys, 2FA, etc)
  * Attack methods (brute force, rainbow tables, etc)
  * Famous attacks and vulnerabilities (shellshock, meltdown, firesheep) Attack vectors seem to be the contrary of companies names, they always choose badass names.

The future

  * Artificial Intelligence
  * The Internet of Things (wearables, appliances)
  * The blockchain and cryptocurrencies
  * 3D printing
  * VR
  * Quantum computing
