A robot that identifies cigarrete butts in the street/sidewalks and picks them up.

I could be a solar-powered drone that takes pictures and identifies cigarrete butts with image recognition, then picks them up with a needle and stores them in a container.

It could be a remore controled toy car that does the same.

Then, move on to identify other kinds of trash.
