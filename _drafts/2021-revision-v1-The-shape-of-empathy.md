      When I was young, my parents bought me many toys. I had (and I want to think I still have) an hyperactive imagination. This resulted in me playing with an specific toy for many days, then forgetting about it until months later, just to begin the cycle again. My mother, watching her scarce income being wasted in toys that seemingly only were being used for a few moments, resorted to use the guilt card. She told me that some of my toys would be sad if I didn&#8217;t play with them. This created a imbalance in my empathy, I soon were feeling much more empathy towards inanimate objects than to other children.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      Looking back, I am not surprised that I felt that way. I am not surprised that some of that contorted empathy still remains in me. What surprises me is the human capacity to have feelings towards things.

      During the recent past I have been working with Watson. Specifically, I worked on a project to create a &#8220;cognitive concierge&#8221;. The goal of this project, as its name implies, was a humanoid robot that would answer question made in natural language.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      Both research and common sense imply that humans will be much more eager and receptive to interact with humanoid robots that talk and imitate human emotions.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      There are many stories where the human counterparts develop some kind of feeling towards robots.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      Some of these stories abandon the idea of humanoid robots entirely, while still keeping the &#8220;humanoid personality&#8221; of the robots. <em>Interstellar</em> is a good example of this. Both TARS and CASE definitely <em>show</em> emotion during the film, ranging from being funny to expressing sadness. However, neither TARS nor CASE are shaped like humanoids. In fact, they have the general shape of a brick, probably as far from human shape as we can get. Despite their shape, both the protagonists and the spectators of the film regard TARS and CASE as extremely likable characters. Why is that? There are several factors that contribute to this. For starters, the <em>Interstellar</em> robots have natural-sounding voices.

  GLaDOS &#8211; GLaDOS is the omnipresent &#8220;villian&#8221; of the Portal videogame series. It has a very robotic voice (which is ironic since a human voice actor recorded all of its messages). However, the actions of GLaDOS are far from empathic  towards humans. In fact, GLaDOS is the controller of the human social experiment that occurs in the Portal game. GLaDOS is a cruel and sarcastic robotic overseer, who does not share any human characteristics (besides the sarcasm and cruelty). In most regards, GLaDOS is the complete opposite of TARS and CASE. The only differences between the Interstellar robots and GLaDOS are their voices and their actions. We have already
