  <strong>Accessibility.</strong> By having the code in a shared server, it is easy for the development team to synchronize and update the code independently of the geographic location of the team.

<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Organization.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>Backups.</strong> As the name implies, version control systems are very useful for permanent storage of previous versions of each file.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Collaboration. The team can collaborate by sharing files (see the first point), but control version systems can also help to conduct code reviews, approvals, revisions, rollbacks.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>Troubleshooting.</strong> By having quick and easy access to previous versions of the source code, it is much easier to identify when a change causes problems, who caused it, and exactly when and how the problems was caused. This is very useful for post-mortem investigations in production environments, as well as for the developers&#8217; learning process.

<li style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>Flexibility.</strong> Version control systems are not only used for handling code, they are also used by non-developers. I have seen examples of this by technical writers, who use a control version system for collaboration in the writing, preparation and edition of document and books. People who support applications use it for storage and handling of tutorials, memorandums, guides and even binary files. It would not be weird to see control version systems used by other disciplines like architecture, medicine, and graphic design.

<li style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>Popularity.</strong> Every company that handles software seriously is using some kind of version control system. Even companies that only write software for maintaining another kind of operations have seen the advantages that having a good control of their code means. This is an advantage for the developers and IT professionals that want to work for this kind of companies. Experience and knowledge in control version systems can be a decisive advantage in interviews with this kind of companies.
