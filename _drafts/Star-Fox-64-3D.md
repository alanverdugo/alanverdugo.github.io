  The 3DS seems to have become a portable Nintendo 64
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The voice track is very similar to the original game, but definitively not the same. Many people complained about this, and I do understand and share some of that frustration. After all, I spend countless hours playing the original Star Fox 64 and most of the quotes are perfectly ingrained in my memory. Hearing the main characters speak differently (even if it just a little different) feels weird and out of place. Thankfully, the more you play this new version, the less of a problem this becomes. This slight change in the voice tracks is an unfortunate (and maybe unnecessary) change, but it is a very small price that I am more than willing to pay in order to enjoy a portable Star Fox 64 with better graphics and wireless multiplayer. We also now have extra voice tracks is other languages. I tried to play switching to Spanish track, since it is my mother language, but it was an error that I only endured briefly. I want to think that the voice actors actually did a great job and I am just too used to hear the original English voices. Those who never played the original game could, of course, never heard any problem here and have a different opinion.

  The low screen resolution of the 3DS and the sharp edges of the Arwings and the enemies often show jagged edges.

  The controls did not suffer as much as with Ocarina of Time 3D. Controlling the Arwing feels as good as with a N64 controller, probably due to the &#8220;on-rails&#8221; nature of Star Fox. A gyroscopic view is also present, but, as with <a href="http://www.kippel.net/blog/?p=519" target="_blank">OoT 3D</a>, it didn&#8217;t feel it as accurate as using normal controls. This is a shame because it would have been great to use a gyroscopic view in a first person mode to control the Arwing, but the often-overlooked first person mode in the original game was removed from this remake.

  The multiplayer mode also suffered some changes. To begin with, we cannot use the Landmaster or the individual characters anymore, only the Arwings. This is a

  There are three play modes for the main game: 3DS, N64 and the unlockable Expert mode. Playing in the 3DS mode is the easiest of them all.

  Star Fox 64 3D is a really good game on its own, but it could have been much better if some things were not removed from the original game. To compensate for that, we have some extra options. It feels like they had to choose which things made it into the game, and in some cases they chose poorly. An online multiplayer mode would have been amazing, and I am sure it would gather a large number of players even years after the game was launched. It could have been nice.
