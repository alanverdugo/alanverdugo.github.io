<h5 style="text-align: center;">
  The first law.
</h5>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>&#8220;Feast not on the flesh; consume only the blood. This is our strength.&#8221;</em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We do not eat the flesh of those we kill for food. We will only drink of their blood and leave the body intact. The consumption of flesh is filthy and unclean. This action is what causes the humans to treat us like animals. We are not animals, we are The Family.
</p>

&nbsp;

<h5 style="text-align: center;">
  The second law.
</h5>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>&#8220;Bear not the child; welcome only the exile. This is our fate.&#8221;</em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Because we carry the stain of our past in our bodies, we can never let it pass to our offspring who would in turn carry out those foul actions beginning the cycle anew. The Family must seek the Wasteland for others of its kind in order to maintain itself. This is our fate.
</p>

&nbsp;

<h5 style="text-align: center;">
  The third law.
</h5>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>&#8220;Feed not for pleasure; partake only to nourish. This is our dignity.&#8221;</em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We only kill the humans when we are hungry or when we must defend ourselves, we never hunt for sport or pleasure. We do not prey on children for they are not yet tainted by society&#8217;s view of us. The Family will not tolerate murder.
</p>

&nbsp;

<h5 style="text-align: center;">
  The fourth law.
</h5>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>&#8220;Seek not the sun&#8217;s light; embrace only the shadows. This is our refuge.&#8221;</em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Because we are creatures of the night, we must not set foot in daylight. We move silently across the ground only under the watchful eye of the moon above. At the rising of the sun, we must seek the embrace of the shadows and never again gaze at its brilliance. The Family seeks the dark as its refuge.
</p>

&nbsp;

<h5 style="text-align: center;">
  The fifth law.
</h5>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>&#8220;Kill not our kindred; slay only the enemy. This is our justice.&#8221;</em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Above all, no member of The Family will ever take the life of another member without the consent of the current leader. Anyone disobeying this action, the most heinous of all our crimes, will be exiled from this place forever. We must not let our own inner demons cause us to fight amongst ourselves, we number only in the few, and we cannot risk extinction.
