Advantages of open source (security, mostly free, variety of licensing, easy to find, diversity on design and development ideas, collaboration, not necessarily motivated by revenue, evolutionary brute force progress rather than budget-dependent, speed in development and fixes)

The fact that copying digital files is effectively free means that the creator is not required to part with his creation in order to share it with the world. This is a very important advantage over physical goods. Other than storage space, no other resource is needed to produce a copy of software. This is a radical change over traditional lines of production like farming or manufacture, where the value of the goods is mainly driven by the effort it took to create said product, the cost associated with its transportation, and supply and demand. There is still effort needed to create open source software, but it is shared among the developers, which can range from 1 to thousands, so the effort is reduced. Thanks to the Internet, the cost of transportation/transmission of software is negligible, even in global distances. Supply and demand does not affect open source software either, since there can be always more copies of the same code, it is not affected by fluctuations in value like rare products or materials do, like gold, diamonds, or other rare metals. All this created a innovative way to &#8220;commercialize&#8221; open source software: being free.

Differences between free software and open source.

Open source technologies have important advantages over closed source software. Its collaborative nature and the fact that the code is widely available means that anybody can contribute to it, or at least, that anybody can suggest changes, not only on the obvious behavior and experience that the programs offer to the user, but also in the underlying design and functionality of the code. In many cases, this has resulted in optimized code.

A special note about Github.

Python

Python was created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum, and it is named after the British comedy Monty Python&#8217;s Flying Circus. It is known for being one of few languages that take indentation seriously. The uses of Python range from web development (with popular web frameworks like Django and Flask), Machine learning, back-end scripting, data processing, etc.
