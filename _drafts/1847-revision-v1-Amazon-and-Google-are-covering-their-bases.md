      The new Amazon Go store was officially announced recently, and I have to say that I love the idea. In fact, I had this same idea last year. My idea was a little different in how it was implemented, but the result was the same: A store where you can walk and take whatever you want and take it home, without any lines or checkout of any kind. I never had time to apply for a patent, but I am actually glad that somebody is making progress in making it a reality. After all, that is what I wanted: a world where shopping is as easy and quick as possible. It does not matter if it is I or Amazon who is making it possible.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      However, there were other reasons why this announcement caught my attention. Amazon is primarily an online store. What would be their motivation to create something like Amazon Go? More importantly, what would be their <em>true</em> motivation to create something like Amazon Go?
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      Like all web services, Amazon has data about everybody who has an account in their site. If they use this for evil purposes or not is beyond the scope of this article, so let&#8217;s forget about conspiracy theories for now. I know that Amazon Go and Alexa have the potential to be Orwellian nightmares, but that is not the topic I want to pursue in this article.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      The amount of money that Amazon will make with just one store is ridiculously small compared to what they make on their online store, and to make an important contribution to Amazon&#8217;s income would take years, if not decades, with a brick-and-mortar strategy. Are they setting themselves up for a very long term plan. So what is behind Amazon Go? At first I thought that they really did have the same idea as me: to patent it and lease the idea to existing real-world stores like Wal-mart. This seems like <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/12/06/amazon-go-surveillance-cameras-shopping-grocery-supermarket/95055200/" target="_blank">it is indeed part of their plan</a>, but I foresee another part of this plan that would be even more profitable for Amazon.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      Now, let&#8217;s look at Google. Amazon and Google are positioning themselves to be arch-rivals in the technology world, but they share much more than what we think.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      The brilliant minds in Google soon realized that it is not enough to just be a search engine. The knew that people were not only using their search engine while they were connected to the Internet. There are other things that people do. We spend a lot of time reading and writing emails, so Google created Gmail. We spend a lot of time in social media, so Google created Google Plus. We spend a lot of time watching videos, so Google created Google Video, and when that was not enough, they bought Youtube. Since the rise of the smartphone, we spend a lot of time using them, so Google created Android and mobile versions of their applications, as well as their own Google-branded hardware.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      Are you seeing the pattern here? If not, stop for a minute and think about it, it is diabolical in its simplicity. It is so simple maybe you haven&#8217;t noticed it yet.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      A normal day in the life of an American adult is waking up, commuting to work, spend a number of hours working, commuting back to home and then rest or spend time with a hobby or other responsibilities, until it is time to go to bed and repeat it all again the next day.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      Both Amazon and Google are data-driven entities. They need data to survive and they know that they must be present in as many aspect of the users&#8217; lives. This data is the natural resource that they are fighting for. Soon, it will no longer be enough for Google to only have usage data of a few hours of the users&#8217; day. Not being present in an aspect of the normal life of a person will mean that a competitor is able to take that place, and that is unacceptable.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
      The commute is one of the last moments of the day where a technology company is not present to gather data. This is why Google is so interested in self-driving cars. It is not just Google being a nice company that wants to take the stress of driving away. They want the commuters to use Google products in their commute, and they will only do so if they no longer need to have the hands on the wheel and the eyes on the road. With an autonomous car, the passengers have time to use their Android smartphone, or use the tablet loaded with Google apps that will be in the car already.
