  This feels like a new generation fairy tale. The graphics are absolutely gorgeous. Some times I just stop playing the game and stare at the screen. While playing I often wondered if the videogame industry jumped into the 3D era too soon, since it is obvious that compelling stories and spectacular games can still be created and enjoyed in pure 2D fashion.

  But Odin Sphere is much more than its visuals. Under the beautiful exterior lies a fun action RPG with a solid story and character diversity.

  I would love to see other great 2D games like Castlevania or Metroid having graphics like these.
